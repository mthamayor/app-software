The\r\n        indiscriminate discharge of untreated industrial and domestic wastes\r\n        into waterways, the spewing of thousands of tons of particulates and\r\n        airborne gases into the atmosphere, the \"throwaway\" attitude toward\r\n        solid wastes, and the use of newly developed chemicals without\r\n        considering potential consequences have resulted in a lot of\r\n        environmental disasters throughout the world.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <div className='text-center'>\r\n        <Paper className='plate'>\r\n          <img className='img img-fluid' src={OpenDrainage} alt='img' />\r\n        </Paper>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <Typography variant='caption' className='mt-2 mb-2 text-center'>\r\n        <strong>Plate 1</strong> Open Drains\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span className='pl-3' />\r\n        Environmental pollution usually occurs as a result of energy conversions\r\n        and the use of resources which leaves their by-products behind in water,\r\n        soil or air.

Strip mining for minerals and coal lays waste thousands of\r\n        acres of land each year, denuding the Earth and subjecting the mined\r\n        area to widespread erosion problems. The increase in urbanization due to\r\n        population pressure presents additional soil-erosion problems; sediment\r\n        loads in nearby streams may increase as much as 500 to 1,000 times over\r\n        that recorded in nearby undeveloped stretches of stream. Soil erosion\r\n        not only despoils the Earth for farming and other uses, but also\r\n        increases the suspended-solids load of the waterway. This increase\r\n        interferes with the ecological habitat and poses silting problems in\r\n        navigation channels, inhibiting the commercial use of these waters. Soil\r\n        erosion is a major problem affecting some states in Nigeria.

Additional\r\n        solid wastes accumulate from mining, industrial production, and\r\n        agriculture. Although, municipal wastes are the most obvious, the\r\n        accumulations of other types of waste are far greater, in many instances\r\n        are more difficult to dispose of, and present greater environmental\r\n        hazards\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        In Nigeria, municipal, industrial and hazardous wastes are a major\r\n        concern and every government is handicapped in dealing with them. The\r\n        most common and convenient method of disposing of municipal solid wastes\r\n        is in the sanitary landfill. Sanitary landfills provide better aesthetic\r\n        control and should be odourfree. Often, however, industrial wastes of\r\n        unknown content are commingled with domestic wastes. Groundwater\r\n        infiltration and contamination of water supplies are common.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        There is need for building engineered landfills besides waste reuse and\r\n        recycling to reduce the waste going to landfills and to increase the\r\n        life of the landfills. Besides landfills, solid wastes may be managed\r\n        through other technologies, viz. incineration for medical and hazardous\r\n        wastes, waste to energy, composting of organic wastes, biogas from\r\n        livestock and slaughterhouses, and more advanced technologies to manage\r\n        radioactive and highly toxic wastes. Recycling of materials is practical\r\n        to some extent for much municipal and some industrial wastes, and a\r\n        small but growing proportion of solid wastes are being recycled. When\r\n        wastes are commingled, however, recovery becomes difficult and\r\n        expensive. New processes of sorting ferrous and nonferrous metals,\r\n        paper, glass, and plastics have been developed, and many communities\r\n        with recycling programs now require refuse separation. Crucial issues in\r\n        recycling are devising better processing methods, inventing new products\r\n        for the recycled materials, and finding new markets for them\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h5>PESTICIDES AND BIOCIDES</h5>\r\n      <p>\r\n        These are organic and inorganic chemicals originally invented and first\r\n        used effectively to better the human environment by controlling\r\n        undesirable life forms such as bacteria, pests, and foraging insects.\r\n        Their effectiveness, however, has caused considerable pollution. The\r\n        persistent, or hard, pesticides, which are relatively inert and\r\n        non-degradable by chemical or biologic activity, are also\r\n        bio-accumulative; that is, they are retained within the body of the\r\n        consuming organism and are concentrated with each ensuing level of the\r\n        biologic food chain. For example, DDT provides an excellent example of\r\n        cumulative pesticide effects. (Although DDT use has been banned in the\r\n        United States since 1972, and in Nigeria more recently, it is still a\r\n        popular pesticide in much of the rest of the world.) Its continued use\r\n        in several countries results in ingestion by higher forms of life:\r\n        algae, fish, shellfish, birds, or humans. The resultant increased\r\n        concentration in the higher life forms (bio-enhancement) may reach\r\n        levels of thousands to millions of parts per billion. Pesticides affect\r\n        birds nesting habits and nervous system of animals and fish; they can\r\n        cause instability, disorientation, and, in some cases, death. These\r\n        examples are generally a result of relatively high body residuals\r\n        producing acute (short-term) readily recordable results. The long-term\r\n        (chronic) effects of persistent pesticides are virtually unknown, but\r\n        many scientists believe that they are as much an environmental hazard as\r\n        are the acute effects. Non-persistent (readily degradable) pesticides or\r\n        substitutes, insect sterilization techniques, hormone homologues that\r\n        check or interfere with maturation stages, and introduction of animals\r\n        that prey on the pests present a potentially brighter picture for pest\r\n        control with significantly reduced environmental consequences.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h5 className='text-center text-uppercase'>NOISE POLLUTION</h5>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Noise pollution has a relatively recent origin. It is a composite of\r\n        sounds generated by human activities ranging from blasting stereo\r\n        systems to the roar of supersonic transport jets. Although, the\r\n        frequency (pitch) of noise may be of major importance, most noise\r\n        sources are measured in terms of intensity, or strength of the sound\r\n        field.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The standard unit, one decibel(dB), is the amount of sound that is just\r\n        audible to the average human. The decibel scale is somewhat misleading\r\n        because it is logarithmic rather than linear; for example, a noise\r\n        source measuring 70 dB is 10 times as loud as a source measuring 60 dB\r\n        and 100 times as loud as a source reading 50dB. Noise may be generally\r\n        associated with industrial society, where heavy machinery, motor\r\n        vehicles, and aircraft have become everyday items. Noise pollution is\r\n        more intense in the work environment than in the general environment,\r\n        although ambient noise increased an average of one dB per year during\r\n        the 1980s.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The average background noise in a typical home today is between 40 and\r\n        50 decibels. Some examples of high-level sources in the environment are\r\n        heavy trucks (90 dB at 15 m/50 ft.), freight trains (75 dB at 15 m/50\r\n        ft.), and air conditioning (60 dB at 6 m/20 ft.). In Nigeria noise is\r\n        becoming a serious problem through road traffic, electricity generating\r\n        sets, music during social events and industrial sources. The most\r\n        readily measurable physiological effect of noise pollution is damage to\r\n        hearing, which may be either temporary or permanent and may cause\r\n        disruption of normal activities or just general annoyance. The effect is\r\n        variable, depending upon individual susceptibility, duration of\r\n        exposure, nature of noise (loudness), and time distribution of exposure\r\n        (such as steady or intermittent). On the average an individual will\r\n        experience a threshold shift (a shift in an individual's upper limit of\r\n        sound detectability) when exposed tonoise levels of 75 to 80dB for\r\n        several hours. This shift will last only several hours once the source\r\n        of noise pollution is removed. A second physiologically important level\r\n        is the threshold of pain, at which even short-term exposure will cause\r\n        physical pain (130 to 140dB). Any noise sustained at this level will\r\n        cause a permanent threshold shift or permanent partial hearing loss. At\r\n        the uppermost level of noise (greater than 150 dB), even a single\r\n        short-term blast may cause traumatic hearing loss and physical damage\r\n        inside the ear.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Although little hard information is available on the psychological side\r\n        effects of increased noise levels, many researchers attribute increased\r\n        irritability, lower productivity, decreased tolerance levels, increased\r\n        incidence of ulcers, migraine headaches, fatigue, and allergic responses\r\n        to continued exposures to high-level noises in the workplace and the\r\n        general environment. Reducing noise pollution by muffling the sounds at\r\n        the source is one of the best methods in industry and for urban living.\r\n        Protective equipment is generally mandatory when noise levels exceed 85\r\n        dB(A) in industry. Creation of green cover adjacent to municipal roads\r\n        and in mines is the way to mitigate noise pollution. It has been\r\n        observed that noise level reduces by 10 decibels per every 10m wide\r\n        green belt development. Apart, redesigning industrial equipment, shock\r\n        mounting assemblies and physical barriers in the workplace are also for\r\n        reduction and exposure of unwanted industrial noise. High way noise\r\n        pollution can be mitigated by constructing noise barriers. Artificial\r\n        noise barriers are solid obstructions built between the highway and the\r\n        residential areas along a highway. They block major portion of noise\r\n        produced by passing vehicles on a highway. Effective noise barriers\r\n        typically reduce noise levels by as much as half or more. The\r\n        construction of noise barrier may be built in the form of earth mounds,\r\n        vertical wall along the highways for creation of blockage of sound\r\n        generated by heavy vehicles. Creation of greenbelt in the space between\r\n        the residences and highways also reduces the noise nuisance.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h5 className='text-center text-uppercase'>AIR POLLUTION</h5>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong className='ml-3'>Air pollution</strong> is the accumulation in\r\n        the atmosphere of substances that, in sufficient concentrations,\r\n        endanger human health or produce other measured effects on living matter\r\n        and other materials. Among the major sources of pollution are power and\r\n        heat generation, the burning of solid wastes, industrial processes, and,\r\n        especially, transportation. The six major types of pollutants are carbon\r\n        monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, particulates, Sulphur-dioxide,\r\n        and photochemical oxidants. Local and Regional Smog has seriously\r\n        affected more persons than any other type of air pollution. It can be\r\n        loosely defined as a multisource, widespread air pollution that occurs\r\n        in the air of cities. Smog, a contraction of the words smoke and fog,\r\n        has been caused throughout recorded history by water condensing on smoke\r\n        particles, usually from burning coal. The infamous London fogs--about\r\n        4,000 deaths were attributed to the severe fog of 1952--were smog of\r\n        this type. Another type, ice fog, occurs only at high latitudes and\r\n        extremely low temperatures and is a combination of smoke particles and\r\n        ice crystals.{' '}\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        As a coal economy has gradually been replaced by a petroleum economy,\r\n        photochemical smog has become predominant in many cities. Its unpleasant\r\n        properties result from the irradiation by sunlight of hydrocarbons\r\n        (primarily unburned gasoline emitted by automobiles and other combustion\r\n        sources) and other pollutants in the air. Irradiation produces a long\r\n        series of photochemical reactions. The products of the reactions include\r\n        organic particles, ozone, aldehydes, ketones, peroxyacetyl nitrate, and\r\n        organic acids and other oxidants. Sulphur dioxide, which is always\r\n        present to some extent, oxidizes and hydrates to form sulphuric acid and\r\n        becomes part of the particulate matter. Furthermore, automobiles are\r\n        polluters even in the absence of photochemical reactions. They are\r\n        responsible for much of the particulate material in the air; they also\r\n        emit carbon monoxide, one of the most toxic constituents of smog. All\r\n        types of smog decrease visibility and, with the possible exception of\r\n        ice fog, are irritating to the respiratory system. Statistical studies\r\n        indicate that smog is a contributor to malignancies of many types.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Photochemical smog produces eye irritation and lacrimation and causes\r\n        severe damage to many types of vegetation, including important crops.\r\n        Acute effects include an increased mortality rate, especially among\r\n        persons suffering from respiratory and coronary ailments. Air pollution\r\n        also has a deleterious effect on works of art. Air pollution on a\r\n        regional scale is in part the result of local air pollution that\r\n        produced by individual sources, such as automobiles--that has spread out\r\n        to encompass areas of many thousands of square kilometers.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Meteorological conditions and landforms can greatly influence\r\n        air-pollution concentrations at any given place, especially locally and\r\n        regionally. For example, cities located in bowls or valleys over which\r\n        atmospheric inversions form and act as imperfect lids are especially\r\n        likely to suffer from incidences of severe smog. Oxides of Sulphur and\r\n        nitrogen, carried long distances by the atmosphere and then precipitated\r\n        in solution as acid rain, can cause serious damage to vegetation,\r\n        waterways, and buildings. Air pollution in Nigeria is also as a result\r\n        of cooking fuels. Many houses still use fire wood or charcoal for\r\n        cooking purposes and this method releases oxides of carbon, nitrogen,\r\n        and Sulphur into the environment. Asthma and bronchitis are the major\r\n        ailments in Nigerian populations. Global Humans also pollute the\r\n        atmosphere on a global scale, although until the early 1970s little\r\n        attention was paid to the possible deleterious effects of such\r\n        pollution. Measurements in Hawaii suggest that the concentration of\r\n        carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing at a rate of about 0.2%\r\n        every year. The effect of this increase may be to alter the Earth's\r\n        climate by increasing the average global temperature. Certain pollutants\r\n        decrease the concentration of ozone occurring naturally in the\r\n        stratosphere, which in turn increases the amount of ultraviolet\r\n        radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Such radiation may damage\r\n        vegetation and increase the incidence of skin cancer.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        {' '}\r\n        Examples of stratospheric contaminants include nitrogen oxides emitted\r\n        by supersonic aircraft and chlorofluorocarbons used as refrigerants and\r\n        aerosol-can propellants. The chlorofluorocarbons reach the stratosphere\r\n        by upward mixing from the lower parts of the atmosphere. It is believed\r\n        that these chemicals are responsible for the noticeable loss of ozone\r\n        over the Polar Regions that have occurred in the 1980s.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The gaseous composition of unpolluted air <br /> The Gases Parts per\r\n        million (vol)\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Nitrogen 756,500</li>\r\n        <li>Oxygen 202,900</li>\r\n        <li>Water 31,200</li>\r\n        <li>Argon 9,000</li>\r\n        <li>Carbon Dioxide 305</li>\r\n        <li>Neon 17.4</li>\r\n        <li>Helium 5.0</li>\r\n        <li>Methane 0.97-1.16</li>\r\n        <li>Krypton 0.97</li>\r\n        <li>Nitrous oxide 0.49</li>\r\n        <li>Hydrogen 0.49</li>\r\n        <li>Xenon 0.08</li>\r\n        <li>Organic vapors ca.0.02</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <h5 className='text-uppercase text-center'>CONTROL OF AIR POLLUTON</h5>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The following should be done to manage and control air pollution; I.

Metallic oxides\r\n        can dissolve in water form alkalis.

For example, in the\r\n        reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl),\r\n        the products are sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H2O).

The degree of solubility\r\n        varies from one base to the other. When, for instance, sodium\r\n        hydroxide was compared with calcium hydroxide with respect to their\r\n        solubility in water, it was found, that sodium hydroxide dissolved\r\n        easily while calcium hydroxide with much difficulty.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Bases which are easily soluble in water are called alkalis. Sodium\r\n        hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) are good examples of\r\n        alkalis. They are soluble bases.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4 className='text-center text-uppercase'>Salts</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Previously, it was said that when an acid is neutralized with a base,\r\n        salt and water are obtained. We can therefore define salt as a product\r\n        of neutralization.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Salt is defined as a compound which consists of a positive metallic\r\n        ion and a negative, non-metallic ion. However, in general terms a salt\r\n        is better defined as an ionic compound containing a positive ion other\r\n        than a hydrogen ion and a negative ion other than the hydroxide ion.\r\n        Sodium chloride, NaCl is a salt composed of the sodium ion, Na+ and\r\n        the chloride ion. Since a salt can be produced by carrying out a\r\n        neutralization reaction, we can conclude that such a compound will be\r\n        neither acidic nor basic. Salts which are produced by the process of\r\n        neutralization are therefore neutral litmus, that is, they will have\r\n        no effect on either red or blue litmus paper.

Acids turned blue litmus paper red\r\n        while bases turned red litmus blue.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Thus, by using litmus paper, we have something which tells us some\r\n        property substance. The litmus paper was thus acting as an indicator.\r\n        Using an indicator is a very useful and reliable way of finding out\r\n        the nature of a substance.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Many colouring materials extracted from plants can act as indicators.\r\n        Extracts from leaves and flowers can often act as indicators.

If we have two acidic solutions\r\n        or two basic solutions, our litmus paper indicator can only tell us\r\n        whether they are acidic or basic, but it cannot tell us which\r\n        solutions contains a higher concentration of H3O + ions.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Similarly, our litmus indicator cannot tell us which of the basic\r\n        solutions contains a higher concentration of the OH ions. This is a\r\n        shortcoming of the use of litmus paper as an indicator. However, it\r\n        has been possible to obtain an indicator which not only tells us\r\n        whether a solution is acidic, but can also distinguish differences in\r\n        the acid content of acidic solutions. This indicator which is called a\r\n        “universal indicator”, changes colour not just into red and blue but\r\n        into many other colours. These various colours of the universal\r\n        indicator correspond to certain degrees of acidity.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        A scale which shows the degree of acidity is called a pH scale. In\r\n        effect. pH simply refers to the concentration of H+ ions in any given\r\n        solution. The pH scales ranges from 0-14. A solution with a low pH\r\n        such as 2 is more acidic than a solution with 6. A solution of 7 is\r\n        neutral; one with a less pH than this is acidic; one with a pH greater\r\n        than 7 is alkaline.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Thus, a solution with a pH of 8 contains less OH- ion than a solution\r\n        with pH of 14.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>The figure below shows a pH scale ranging from 0-14.</p>\r\n      <div className='text-center'>\r\n        <Paper className='plate'>\r\n          <img className='img img-fluid' src={PhScale} alt='img' />\r\n        </Paper>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Acids;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport Table from '@material-ui/core/Table';\r\nimport TableBody from '@material-ui/core/TableBody';\r\nimport TableCell from '@material-ui/core/TableCell';\r\nimport TableHead from '@material-ui/core/TableHead';\r\nimport TableRow from '@material-ui/core/TableRow';\r\nimport Paper from '@material-ui/core/Paper';\r\nimport { Typography } from '@material-ui/core';\r\nimport Analogous from '../assets/img/analogous.png';\r\nimport PlantAnalogous from '../assets/img/plant-analogous.png';\r\n\r\nconst createData = (name, classification, description) => {\r\n  return { name, classification, description };\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst rows = [\r\n  createData('Kingdom', 'Animalia', 'all animals same as zebra'),\r\n  createData('Phylum', 'Chordata', 'all animals with a backbone'),\r\n  createData('Class', 'Mammalian', 'animals with a backbone, which have hair'),\r\n  createData('Order', 'Primate', 'mammals with hands and feet'),\r\n  createData('Family', 'Hominidae', 'apes, primitive humans and modern humans'),\r\n  createData('Genus', 'Homo', 'primitive humans and modern humans only'),\r\n  createData(\r\n    'Species',\r\n    'sapiens',\r\n    'modern humans only (scientific name: homo sapiens)'\r\n  )\r\n];\r\n\r\nconst LivingThings = props => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className='p-3'>\r\n      <div className=\"text-center\">\r\n        <h3>CHARACTERISTICS AND CLASSIFICATION OF LIVING THINGS</h3>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span className='pl-3' />\r\n        It is obvious that people are living things. Most of us realize that\r\n        plants are living too, but what about a car? Cars need fuel, and can\r\n        do many of the things that animals and plants can do. An individual\r\n        living thing, such as an animal or a plant, is called an organism. The\r\n        term ‘living organism’ is usually used to describe something which\r\n        displays all the characteristics of living things. Examples of living\r\n        things are man, animals, plants, etc.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4 className='text-uppercase text-center'>\r\n        Characteristics of living things\r\n      </h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span className='pl-3' />\r\n        There are seven activities which make organisms different from\r\n        non-living things. These are the seven characteristics of living\r\n        organisms.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Nutrition: </strong> Living things take in materials from\r\n          their surroundings that they use for growth or to provide energy.\r\n          Nutrition is the process by which organisms obtain energy and raw\r\n          materials from nutrients such as proteins, carbohydrates and fats.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Respiration: </strong>Respiration is the release of energy\r\n          from food substances in all living cells. Living things break down\r\n          food within their cells to release energy for carrying out the\r\n          following processes.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Movement: </strong> All living things move. It is very\r\n          obvious that a leopard moves but what about the thorn tree it sits\r\n          in? Plants also move in various different ways. The movement may be\r\n          so slow that it is very difficult to see.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Excretion: </strong> All living things excrete. As a result\r\n          of the many chemicals reactions occurring in cells, they have to get\r\n          rid of waste products which might poison the cells. Excretion is\r\n          defined as the removal of toxic materials, the waste products of\r\n          metabolism and substances in excess from the body of an organism.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Growth: </strong> Growth is seen in all living things. It\r\n          involves using food to produce new cells. The permanent increase in\r\n          cell number and size is called growth.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Reproduction: </strong> All living organisms have the\r\n          ability to produce offspring.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Sensitivity: </strong> All living things are able to sense\r\n          and respond to stimuli around them such as light, temperature,\r\n          water, gravity and chemical substances.

Each one of these characteristics will be studied\r\n          in detail during the course. Whilst many other things carry out one\r\n          or more of the above processes, only living organisms possess all of\r\n          these characteristics.\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ol>\r\n      <h5 className='text-center text-uppercase'>\r\n        Classification of living organisms\r\n      </h5>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span className='pl-3' />\r\n        If you have ever been to a library, you will know how much easier it\r\n        is to find a book on a particular subject if the books are arranged in\r\n        subject groups. When the librarian has a new book to add to the\r\n        library, he or she will group it with books on a similar topic,\r\n        according to a classification system.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h6 className='text-uppercase'>\r\n        The use of the hierarchical classification system\r\n      </h6>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span className='mr-3' />\r\n        Classification helps us to impose order and a general plan on the\r\n        diversity of living things. Scientists have always tried to organize\r\n        and classify the objects, including living organisms, around them.\r\n        Classification can be defined as grouping organisms according to their\r\n        structural similarities. This means that organisms that share similar\r\n        features are placed in one group.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span className='mr-3' />\r\n        These groups are arranged from the largest group of organisms to the\r\n        smallest group of organisms. The groups, from largest to smallest, are\r\n        arranged as follows:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>kingdom</li>\r\n        <li>phylum (plural phyla)</li>\r\n        <li> class</li>\r\n        <li>order</li>\r\n        <li>family</li>\r\n        <li>genus (plural genera)</li>\r\n        <li> species.</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span className='mr-3' />\r\n        The <strong>species</strong> is the smallest group of organisms. As\r\n        you go through the classification hierarchy, you will see that\r\n        scientists have used broader features to put organisms into{' '}\r\n        <strong>kingdoms</strong>, which are the largest groups of organisms.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span className='mr-3' />\r\n        When you move down towards the species, which are the smallest groups\r\n        of organisms, features are becoming specific. In other words, two\r\n        organisms that belong to the same species share more features than\r\n        those in the same kingdom but in different species.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span className='mr-3' />\r\n        <strong>Species</strong> can be defined as a group of organisms with\r\n        similar features, and these organisms are capable of breeding and\r\n        produce fertile offspring. You are probably aware of the fact that\r\n        horses and donkeys belong to the same kingdom, phylum, class, order,\r\n        family as well as genus but they are from different species.\r\n        Therefore, if a donkey and the horse happen to breed, they produce an\r\n        offspring called a mule. The mule is infertile, meaning that it cannot\r\n        reproduce offspring because it is a product of organisms of different\r\n        species.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span className='mr-3' />\r\n        Classification hierarchy has many uses. First, it helps scientists to\r\n        sort organisms in order. Second, it helps them to identify new\r\n        organisms by finding out which group they fit. Third, it is easier to\r\n        study organisms when they are sorted in groups.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h5 className='text-center text-uppercase'>\r\n        The hierarchical classification system\r\n      </h5>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span className='mr-3' />\r\n        There are various sizes of groups into which living organisms are put.\r\n        The largest group is the kingdom.

You\r\n        could put all the animals that fly in the same group. This group would\r\n        then include birds, bats and many insects. You could put all animals\r\n        that live in water and have streamlined, fish-like bodies in the same\r\n        group. This group would then include fish and whales. Artificial\r\n        classification systems are also used as the basis for Dichotomous keys\r\n        that biologists use to identify organisms.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default LivingThings;\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { MuiThemeProvider, Grid, createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core';\nimport { HashRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { Acids, LivingThings, EnvPollution } from './components';\n\nconst theme = createMuiTheme({\n  palette: {\n    primary: { main: '#43a047' }, // Purple and green play nicely together.\n    secondary: { main: '#11cb5f' } // This is just green.A700 as hex.\n  },\n  typography: {\n    useNextVariants: true\n  }\n});\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <MuiThemeProvider theme={theme}>\n        <Grid className='h-100' container>\n          <Router>\n            <Route exact path='/' component={EnvPollution} />\n            <Route path='/env_pollution' component={EnvPollution} />\n            <Route path='/acids' component={Acids} />\n            <Route path='/living_things' component={LivingThings} />\n          </Router>\n        </Grid>\n      </MuiThemeProvider>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
